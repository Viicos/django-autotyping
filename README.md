`django-autotyping` enhances your developing experience with Django by providing accurate type hints, without the need for
a custom IDE or mypy plugin:

- Generates custom [type stubs](https://typing.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/stubs.html#stubs) based on the current state of your Django application, enhancing your development experience by providing auto-completions and accurate type checking.
- Automatically add explicit type hints to your source code when type stubs are not enough.

To understand the *why* and *how*, you can refer to the [context section](https://viicos.github.io/django-autotyping/context/).

`django-autotyping` is built with [LibCST](https://github.com/Instagram/LibCST/).

> [!WARNING]
> This project is still work in progress. It is meant to work with [`django-stubs`](https://github.com/typeddjango/django-stubs), but some improvements and changes are probably going to be
> implemented in the stub definitions, and could potentially require some changes to the generated stubs.

# Installation

Through `pip`:

```sh
pip install django-autotyping
```

To make use of the dynamic stubs feature, you will also need to install [`django-stubs`](https://github.com/typeddjango/django-stubs):

```sh
pip install django-stubs
```

## Configuration

As any Django application, you will need to add `django_autotyping` to your [`INSTALLED_APPS`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/settings/#std-setting-INSTALLED_APPS)
(preferably in your development or local settings, if you already have them separated).

The application is configurable through the `AUTOTYPING` dict:

```python
AUTOTYPING = {
    "STUBS_GENERATION": {
        "LOCAL_STUBS_DIR": Path(BASE_DIR, "typings"),
    }
}
```

> [!TIP]
> To get typing and auto-completion support, you can make use of the `AutotypingSettingsDict` helper:
>
>   ```python
>   from django_autotyping.typing import AutotypingSettingsDict
>
>   AUTOTYPING: AutotypingSettingsDict = {
>       ...
>   }
>   ```

`django-autotyping` provides several linting rules, identified with the pattern `DJA00X` or `DJAS00X`. Rules can be disabled
using the `IGNORE` setting value.

For a complete list of available configuration values, refer to the usage section of [dynamic stubs](https://viicos.github.io/django-autotyping/usage/dynamic_stubs/)
and [explicit type hints](https://viicos.github.io/django-autotyping/usage/explicit_type_hints/).
