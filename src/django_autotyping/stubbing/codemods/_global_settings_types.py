    TIME_ZONE: str | None
    """Default: ``None``

    A string representing the time zone for this database connection or ``None``.
    This inner option of the :setting:`DATABASES` setting accepts the same values
    as the general :setting:`TIME_ZONE` setting.

    When :setting:`USE_TZ` is ``True``, reading datetimes from the database
    returns aware datetimes with the timezone set to this option's value if not
    ``None``, or to UTC otherwise.

    When :setting:`USE_TZ` is ``False``, it is an error to set this option.

    * If the database backend doesn't support time zones (e.g. SQLite, MySQL,
    Oracle), Django reads and writes datetimes in local time according to this
    option if it is set and in UTC if it isn't.

    Changing the connection time zone changes how datetimes are read from and
    written to the database.

    * If Django manages the database and you don't have a strong reason to do
        otherwise, you should leave this option unset. It's best to store datetimes
        in UTC because it avoids ambiguous or nonexistent datetimes during daylight
        saving time changes. Also, receiving datetimes in UTC keeps datetime
        arithmetic simple — there's no need to consider potential offset changes
        over a DST transition.

    * If you're connecting to a third-party database that stores datetimes in a
        local time rather than UTC, then you must set this option to the
        appropriate time zone. Likewise, if Django manages the database but
        third-party systems connect to the same database and expect to find
        datetimes in local time, then you must set this option.

    * If the database backend supports time zones (e.g., PostgreSQL), then the
    database connection's time zone is set to this value.

    Although setting the ``TIME_ZONE`` option is very rarely needed, there are
    situations where it becomes necessary. Specifically, it's recommended to
    match the general :setting:`TIME_ZONE` setting when dealing with raw queries
    involving date/time functions like PostgreSQL's ``date_trunc()`` or
    ``generate_series()``, especially when generating time-based series that
    transition daylight savings.

    This value can be changed at any time, the database will handle the
    conversion of datetimes to the configured time zone.

    However, this has a downside: receiving all datetimes in local time makes
    datetime arithmetic more tricky — you must account for possible offset
    changes over DST transitions.

    Consider converting to local time explicitly with ``AT TIME ZONE`` in raw SQL
    queries instead of setting the ``TIME_ZONE`` option.

            Default: ``False``

            A boolean that turns on/off debug mode.

            Never deploy a site into production with :setting:`DEBUG` turned on.

            One of the main features of debug mode is the display of detailed error pages.
            If your app raises an exception when :setting:`DEBUG` is ``True``, Django will
            display a detailed traceback, including a lot of metadata about your
            environment, such as all the currently defined Django settings (from
            ``settings.py``).

            As a security measure, Django will *not* include settings that might be
            sensitive, such as :setting:`SECRET_KEY`. Specifically, it will exclude any
            setting whose name includes any of the following:

            * ``'API'``
            * ``'KEY'``
            * ``'PASS'``
            * ``'SECRET'``
            * ``'SIGNATURE'``
            * ``'TOKEN'``

            Note that these are *partial* matches. ``'PASS'`` will also match PASSWORD,
            just as ``'TOKEN'`` will also match TOKENIZED and so on.

            Still, note that there are always going to be sections of your debug output
            that are inappropriate for public consumption. File paths, configuration
            options and the like all give attackers extra information about your server.

            It is also important to remember that when running with :setting:`DEBUG`
            turned on, Django will remember every SQL query it executes. This is useful
            when you're debugging, but it'll rapidly consume memory on a production server.

            Finally, if :setting:`DEBUG` is ``False``, you also need to properly set
            the :setting:`ALLOWED_HOSTS` setting. Failing to do so will result in all
            requests being returned as "Bad Request (400)".

            .. note::

                The default :file:`settings.py` file created by :djadmin:`django-admin
                startproject <startproject>` sets ``DEBUG = True`` for convenience.

                The value of ``DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD`` will be respected when creating new
                auto-created through tables for many-to-many relationships.

                Unfortunately, the primary keys of existing auto-created through tables
                cannot currently be updated by the migrations framework.

                This means that if you switch the value of ``DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD`` and then
                generate migrations, the primary keys of the related models will be
                updated, as will the foreign keys from the through table, but the primary
                key of the auto-created through table will not be migrated.

                In order to address this, you should add a
                :class:`~django.db.migrations.operations.RunSQL` operation to your
                migrations to perform the required ``ALTER TABLE`` step. You can check the
                existing table name through ``sqlmigrate``, ``dbshell``, or with the
                field's ``remote_field.through._meta.db_table`` property.

                Explicitly defined through models are already handled by the migrations
                system.

                Allowing automatic migrations for the primary key of existing auto-created
                through tables :ticket:`may be implemented at a later date <32674>`.

            paths until it finds a module that actually defines the given format. This
            means that formats defined in packages farther up in the list will take

                Application :attr:`labels <django.apps.AppConfig.label>` — by default the

            Default: ``None``

            A tuple representing an HTTP header/value combination that signifies a request
            is secure. This controls the behavior of the request object's ``is_secure()``
            method.

            By default, ``is_secure()`` determines if a request is secure by confirming
            that a requested URL uses ``https://``. This method is important for Django's
            CSRF protection, and it may be used by your own code or third-party apps.

            If your Django app is behind a proxy, though, the proxy may be "swallowing"
            whether the original request uses HTTPS or not. If there is a non-HTTPS
            connection between the proxy and Django then ``is_secure()`` would always
            return ``False`` -- even for requests that were made via HTTPS by the end user.
            In contrast, if there is an HTTPS connection between the proxy and Django then
            ``is_secure()`` would always return ``True`` -- even for requests that were
            made originally via HTTP.

            In this situation, configure your proxy to set a custom HTTP header that tells
            Django whether the request came in via HTTPS, and set
            ``SECURE_PROXY_SSL_HEADER`` so that Django knows what header to look for.

            Set a tuple with two elements -- the name of the header to look for and the
            required value. For example::

                SECURE_PROXY_SSL_HEADER = ("HTTP_X_FORWARDED_PROTO", "https")

            This tells Django to trust the ``X-Forwarded-Proto`` header that comes from our
            proxy and that the request is guaranteed to be secure (i.e., it originally came
            in via HTTPS) when:

            * the header value is ``'https'``, or
            * its initial, leftmost value is ``'https'`` in the case of a comma-separated
            list of protocols (e.g. ``'https,http,http'``).

            You should *only* set this setting if you control your proxy or have some other
            guarantee that it sets/strips this header appropriately.

            Note that the header needs to be in the format as used by ``request.META`` --
            all caps and likely starting with ``HTTP_``. (Remember, Django automatically
            adds ``'HTTP_'`` to the start of x-header names before making the header
            available in ``request.META``.)

            .. warning::

                **Modifying this setting can compromise your site's security. Ensure you
                fully understand your setup before changing it.**

                Make sure ALL of the following are true before setting this (assuming the
                values from the example above):

                * Your Django app is behind a proxy.
                * Your proxy strips the ``X-Forwarded-Proto`` header from all incoming
                requests, even when it contains a comma-separated list of protocols. In
                other words, if end users include that header in their requests, the
                proxy will discard it.
                * Your proxy sets the ``X-Forwarded-Proto`` header and sends it to Django,
                but only for requests that originally come in via HTTPS.

                If any of those are not true, you should keep this setting set to ``None``
                and find another way of determining HTTPS, perhaps via custom middleware.

            .. note::
                Since Django was first released with the :setting:`TIME_ZONE` set to
                ``'America/Chicago'``, the global setting (used if nothing is defined in
                your project's ``settings.py``) remains ``'America/Chicago'`` for backwards
                compatibility. New project templates default to ``'UTC'``.

            Note that this isn't necessarily the time zone of the server. For example, one
            server may serve multiple Django-powered sites, each with a separate time zone
            setting.

            When :setting:`USE_TZ` is ``False``, this is the time zone in which Django
            will store all datetimes. When :setting:`USE_TZ` is ``True``, this is the
            default time zone that Django will use to display datetimes in templates and
            to interpret datetimes entered in forms.

            On Unix environments (where :func:`time.tzset` is implemented), Django sets the
            ``os.environ['TZ']`` variable to the time zone you specify in the
            :setting:`TIME_ZONE` setting. Thus, all your views and models will
            automatically operate in this time zone. However, Django won't set the ``TZ``
            environment variable if you're using the manual configuration option as
            described in :ref:`manually configuring settings
            <settings-without-django-settings-module>`. If Django doesn't set the ``TZ``
            environment variable, it's up to you to ensure your processes are running in
            the correct environment.

            .. note::
                Django cannot reliably use alternate time zones in a Windows environment.

            Default: ``'Lax'``

            The value of the `SameSite`_ flag on the session cookie. This flag prevents the
            cookie from being sent in cross-site requests thus preventing CSRF attacks and
            making some methods of stealing session cookie impossible.

            Possible values for the setting are:

            * ``'Strict'``: prevents the cookie from being sent by the browser to the
            target site in all cross-site browsing context, even when following a regular
            link.

            For example, for a GitHub-like website this would mean that if a logged-in
            user follows a link to a private GitHub project posted on a corporate
            discussion forum or email, GitHub will not receive the session cookie and the
            user won't be able to access the project. A bank website, however, most
            likely doesn't want to allow any transactional pages to be linked from
            external sites so the ``'Strict'`` flag would be appropriate.

            * ``'Lax'`` (default): provides a balance between security and usability for
            websites that want to maintain user's logged-in session after the user
            arrives from an external link.

            In the GitHub scenario, the session cookie would be allowed when following a
            regular link from an external website and be blocked in CSRF-prone request
            methods (e.g. ``POST``).

            * ``'None'`` (string): the session cookie will be sent with all same-site and
            cross-site requests.

            * ``False``: disables the flag.

            .. note::

                Modern browsers provide a more secure default policy for the ``SameSite``
                flag and will assume ``Lax`` for cookies without an explicit value set.

            unencrypted session cookie with a packet sniffer and use the cookie to hijack
            the user's session.
